Broken Pipes Readme
Zakary Olyarnik
January 2017

INTRODUCTION:
Use tools to fix the pipes as they burst!  Some tools take longer to use, but pipes will stay fixed for longer!
Don't let all the water drain!

RUNNING THE GAME:
I have provided a Windows build (Broken Pipes.exe) and a WebGL build (index.html), both located in the Builds
subfolder, and both tested for validity.  The Windows build must be run with 800x600 resolution to display as
intended, due to the unpredictable way Unity's UI scales to different resolutions.  I also made and included a
Mac build but have been unable to test it.

ASSETS:
All sprite images used were created by me in Photoshop.
The water sound effect (originally "Shower, A.wav" by InspectorJ of Freesound.org) is used under a Creative
Commons license.

NOTES:
There was nothing especially difficult about this assignment.  Most of my problems occurred from failing to think
about edge cases until I tested, for example what happened when the player tried to fix a hole without first
selecting a tool.  The game may still require some numbers-tweaking, like the amount of clicks required to fix a
hole with the different tools, or how fast the water drains per broken pipe.  In the future, I'd like to learn the
correct way to use Unity's scaling UI, and as always, my artwork leaves much to be desired.
This project took approximately 19 hours to complete.
